The Georgia Recycling Coalition (GRC) and The Georgia Department of Economic Development's Center of Innovation for Energy have partnered to provide a [map and directory](/localsite/map/#show=recyclers&state=GA) for locating commercial recyclers to facilitate the diversion of recovered materials from landfills.  

The Georgia Commercial Recycling directory contains commercial recycling businesses that sort, collect, process, and broker recovered materials as well as manufacturers in Georgia that use recovered materials to manufacture products. 

We encourage businesses in Georgia to submit and update their data using our [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScP1U_1SW_0fY8e3uote_Aq8eS1UNzvQioYwy2L1y0UdgyT5w/viewform?usp=sf_link).  Our commercial recycling map does not include local government drop-off sites.  View more [recycling&nbsp;data&nbsp;sources](/localsite/map/recycling/ga).
